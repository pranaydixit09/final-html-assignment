        <h1>Chest press</h1>
        <p>The chest press is a classic upper-body strengthening exercise that works your pectorals (chest), deltoids (shoulders), and triceps (arms). For the best results and safety, it’s essential that you use proper form and good technique.If you’re just starting out, find a personal trainer or workout buddy who can spot you, monitor your form, and give feedback. There are several chest press variations that you can do with or without a machine.</p>
        <h1>Benefits</h1>
        <p>The chest press is one of the best chest exercises for building upper body strength. Other effective exercises include pec deck, cable crossover, and dips. The chest press targets your pectorals, deltoids, and triceps, building muscle tissue and strength. It also works your serratus anterior and biceps.This upper body strength and power help with daily activities such as pushing strollers, shopping carts, and heavy doors. It’s also beneficial for sports such as swimming, tennis, and baseball. Other benefits of strength training include enhanced fitness level, stronger bones, and better mental health. You’ll gain muscle and lose fat, helping to burn more calories even while at rest. These benefits may help you to look and feel better, which can increase your confidence and well-being.</p>
        <h1>Steps to perform the exercise</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep your spine flat throughout the exercise and avoid arching your low back.</li>
            <li>Press your head, shoulders, and buttocks into the bench the entire time</li>
            <li>You can use a raised platform under your feet</li>
            <li>Press your feet firmly into the floor or platform throughout the exercise.</li>
            <li>To target your triceps, draw your elbows in close to your sides.</li>
            <li>To target your pectorals, flare your elbows out away from your body.</li>
            <li>Keep your wrists neutral so they don’t bend in either direction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Shoulder Press</h1>
        <p>The shoulder press is an upper-body-focused movement that allows you to increase your overhead strength. When done correctly, it can lead to a significant increase in your shoulders’ size. It’s a fantastic exercise to include in your routine, whether you’re an athlete, a casual lifter, or an older person looking to maintain muscle mass. Usually, people choose either dumbbells or barbells when doing shoulder presses — but kettlebells and resistance bands are also an option. There are even machines that can help you complete this exercise if you’re having trouble with it. However, most people won’t find it necessary, as beginners can easily do shoulder presses with the correct guidance.</p>
        <h1>Benefits</h1>
        <p>Much like muscles, bones can get stronger to support the amount of weight you usually lift. In turn, this decreases the risk of osteoporosis — a condition that debilitates the bones, causing easier fractures and loss of height. Besides working your upper body, shoulder presses also focus your core as a means to stabilize your elbows, wrists, and shoulders. This results in an improved balance and posture — even more so when it comes to standing shoulder presses. Like most other weightlifting exercises, shoulder presses greatly contribute to improving your upper body strength. Performing this exercise correctly will lead to strengthened trapezius, pectoral, triceps, and deltoid muscles.</p>
        <h1>Steps to perform the exercise</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Place a barbell with the desired weight on a rack, making sure that it’s at shoulder height.</li>
            <li>Dip under the bar and place yourself underneath the barbell, picking it up as you slowly straighten yourself up. If this is done correctly, the barbell should then rest at the top of your shoulders.</li>
            <li>Grab the bar with your palms facing upwards — your elbows should point straight ahead. Make sure that your back is straight to secure proper form</li>
            <li>Gently step back from the rack, keeping your back tall — then, simply press the barbell overhead. Once you can’t extend your arms any further, slowly return the barbell to your shoulders and repeat as many times as you need to</li>
            <li>After the final repetition, step into the rack and leave the barbell at shoulder height once again. Finally, dip under the bar and step away from the rack without the bar</li>
        </ul>
